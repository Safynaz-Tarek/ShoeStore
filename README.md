# Application Summary:

The Shoe Store application is an Android app developed as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program. The app allows users to browse and purchase shoes from a virtual shoe store.

The app includes a user-friendly interface where users can view a list of available shoes, along with their details such as size, color, and price. Users can also add shoes to their cart and proceed to checkout to complete their purchase.

The Shoe Store app uses SQLite database to store and manage user data, including the users' shoe orders and cart items. The app also includes a login and registration system to allow users to create and manage their accounts.

In addition to purchasing shoes, the app also includes a feature to add new shoes to the store inventory. Store managers can add new shoes with their details, such as brand, size, and price, to keep the store inventory up-to-date.

# Technical Features:

1. Navigation Component: The app uses the Navigation component to handle navigation between different screens and implement a consistent navigation pattern across the app.

3. Data Binding: The app uses data binding to bind UI components in the layout to the app's data sources, such as the shoe inventory and user data.

5. ViewModels: The app uses ViewModels to store and manage UI-related data, separate from the UI components. This helps to ensure that the data persists across configuration changes, such as when the device is rotated.

7. LiveData: The app uses LiveData to observe changes in the ViewModel and update the UI components accordingly. LiveData ensures that the UI reflects the current state of the data.

9. Room Database: The app uses the Room library to create and manage a local SQLite database, which stores the shoe inventory and user data. Room provides a convenient way to handle database operations, such as querying, inserting, and updating data.

11. RecyclerView: The app uses a RecyclerView to display the list of shoes and cart items. RecyclerView is a flexible and efficient way to display large data sets in a list or grid format.

Overall, the Shoe Store application demonstrates the use of several key Android development concepts and libraries, including navigation, data binding, ViewModel, LiveData, Room, and RecyclerView. These features help to create a robust and maintainable app that provides a great user experience.
